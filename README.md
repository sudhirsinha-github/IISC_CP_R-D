This repo is an R\&D workspace for the Capstone Project by IISc Group 18.

It explores both **unsupervised** (Topic Modeling) and **supervised** (Text Categorization) approaches for analyzing conversational data.

Topic Modeling (e.g., BERTopic) helps uncover hidden themes in unlabeled chats, useful for exploratory analysis.

Text Categorization uses labeled data to train models (e.g., DistilBERT) for classifying queries into known categories like *refund*, *account*, etc.

Together, these methods support scalable understanding and automation of customer interactions.
